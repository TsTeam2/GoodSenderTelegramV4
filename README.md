Put your BOTTOKEN and CHATID in config.ini

Learning to receive BOTTOKEN and CHATID:
Create a bot via bot https://t.me/BotFather and then use the option API Token to get BOTTOKEN.

You can use the bot https://t.me/get_id_bot to get CHATID, just start this bot and it will show you your CHATID.

Note:
You must have started the bot using APITOKEN|BOTTOKEN /START, otherwise the bot cannot send you messages.
Also note that if your CHATID is related to a group or channel, your bot must be a member of that group or channel and have access to send messages.
